184,2/22/2023,1677098636,Reflections on teaching the day after at Michigan State University,"I am a split-position faculty+staff member at MSU. I thought I would write some reflections to share here about my own experiences returning to campus and teaching after the February 13th shooting on our campus. These reflections are purely my own. I want to emphasize that everyone has different reactions and processes traumatic events or injustice in their own way, and my experiences may not resonate with others.       \-Going back to work.      The reason I went back to work is because I care about and value my students - as otherwise, the job is absolutely not worth it. They are wonderful human beings, compassionate, gracious, kind, smart, and young activists. I am not expressing bland positivity here  I dont particularly like many students, but the ones I'm privileged to work with have values and goals that I think are important for our community and world. They are what make the job worth it, and seeing them in class is what is keeping me going. Their response and strength has been incredible.       \-We dont have time to process and respond to one injustice/trauma before getting overwhelmed with another.      From the pandemic, to the faÃ§ade of a return to normalcy, to continuing racial injustice in the country, to a literal insurrection at our nations Capitol, to worsening economic conditions virtually everywhere, to ever-increasing catastrophe from climate change, it feels like a barrage of trauma and injustice that leaves us with no time to process or rebuild before yet another occurs. At MSU, over the past few years weve had the community trauma from the Nassar sexual abuse (plus just last month we got a public report that highlighted how sexual violence is a continuing issue here particularly for vulnerable groups), multiple high-profile incidents of racial bias and harassment, our president leaving last semester during another controversy, and now this mass shooting. Fuck this neverending shit.       \-The burden from university leadership is constantly shifted to the frontline faculty/staff workers.      In the days following the shooting, university leadership has given speeches and held events, and some of what theyve said is thoughtful, but my own perception is that the focus has been too much on protecting the brand/identity of the university.       However, in terms of the university response about going forward, there has not been much specific guidance. Students are promised grace and flexibility as the semester continues from their faculty, and they have moved all classes out of the buildings that saw gunshots. But as faculty, weve been given little direction as to how to accommodate this grace and flexibility. The response reminds me so much of COVID-19, where the burden of work was shifted to the frontline workers, the faculty and staff who keep the university and classes running. It feels like we are left to figure it out for what the response will be. Weve had events about teaching the day after an event like this and they have been helpful for processing how to return to the classroom and talk to students, but that is only one segment of rebuilding for this semester and beyond.      The university-wide email to faculty told us You should feel confident in adjusting syllabus expectations as needed. The university response  Just update your syllabus!  reflects the disconnect between administration, and the people who teach and support students.       This is highlighted by the fact (as some posts have noted on this sub) that some faculty have been incredibly insensitive in returning right to content, exams, and requirements for attendance. I already knew this from working with some such faculty, but some of them lost a sense of compassion somewhere in their lives, probably during their PhD when it was beaten out of them. Academia is overflowing with bullying, abuse, presumed meritocracy, and detachment from reality, and during events like this, it shows.      \-The numbness and sense of inevitability of injustice - yet the need for activism and disruptive protest      With the rate of mass shooting in the US, I always viewed it as a distinct possibility that one would happen near me, and have thought about it at some point almost every time Ive taught a class. I also teach politically-charged topics, and have viewed being targeted as a distinct possibility.       Stand at a busy intersection, and you will likely inevitably see an accident. Live in the US, you may eventually experience a shooting. It does not make it any less horrifying or scary, but this reality has left me with a sense of numbness, like this was unsurprising  when this should be shocking, terrifying, and surprising, because it (should) rarely ever happen, like in so many other places where this is in fact a rarity.       I am massively in favor of gun control and my ideal would be to live in a place with few guns, in addition to a robust social support network including universal healthcare, workers' rights, labor unions, and high pay for teachers/mental health workers/childcare workers/elderly workers, and all the other truly essential jobs that create the fabric of our of society.       I think what brings me the most anger is the amount of people who rush to the defense of guns/gun ownership no matter the frequency and scale of the violence caused by them in the US  particularly in a state like Michigan where it is part of the shitty culture here. Part of my life goal is to prevent and undo the damage such people, policies, and laws create - as well as to highlight in my teaching and advocacy on campus that overwhelming research shows that gun control works.

544,2/7/2023,1675779468,The Reddit Guide to MSU (warning: its pretty long (TWSS)),"Ive seen a lot of people on this sub ask the same questions a lot. I figured, being a senior, I would do my part for the next generation of Spartans. Here is my list of things to help you succeed at MSU as a freshman, transfer, or alumni. Hope you enjoy:      Rule 1: it is strongly encouraged that a refresher driving course is taken before your time at MSU. The drivers here are world class and the course would help others to stay safe. Im sending a personal invitation to the girl driving her Mercedes in the STEM parking lot who looked right (and only right) while trying to make a right hand turn whilst finding a parking spot. Not a care in the world for anyone else driving that day.       Rule 2: if you park somewhere you arent supposed to, or dont pay when required (no matter your feelings on the subject), and get in trouble via fine/towing& thats on you big dogs, not the towing company, not MSU, not the lord almighty Reggie Christ.       Rule 3: Possibly the second most important rule on the list (see final rule for most important), ASK YOUR ADVISOR. Not Payton Thorne, not Tom Izzo, not your cousin Cletus&YOUR ADVISOR. It may be hard to believe but your advisor is there to give you advice on the many rigors of college, and if they dont know the answer, youre SOL. When in doubt about any concern, question, etc&ASK YOUR ADVISOR.      Rule 4: Going along with rule 4 is cut out the middle man. If you have a financial aid question, contact the financial aid office. Grade question? Office of the Registrar! Its amazing what we can accomplish when we logically ask the correct people for certain things.      Rule 5: Freshman: I promise you no one cares about you showing off your parents money except the jealous girls (if youre a girl) in your sorority. Dress like a bum like the rest of us, we all hate it here as it is we dont need you to make us more miserable.      Rule 6: no matter how confident your are, your pullout game is not that good. Wear a jimmy my boy. College is cheaper than a child, keep it that way.       Rule 7: dont be a dick head to the people who help you around campus (or even off campus). The food staff (not limited to) is literally feeding you, be respectful of their time and effort.      Rule 8: Freshman: the campus is overall safe. There are a few tips and tricks to making it safer for you and your friend group: be a male, be white. Once you master these two things youre set!       Rule 9: MSU (and all colleges really) are not the best for reporting cases of sexual assault. The sexual assault healthcare program is truly a great place and for anyone who has had this happen to them and can help you to make the best decision for you. Girls: dont be afraid to speak up. You dont have to go through that alone.      Rule 10: Trust me in this one&dont expect to walk from Lot 89 to the main areas of campus. You will be eaten by squirrels or ran over by a train if you try.      Rule 11: enjoy your time here. Meet new people, but never let your guard down. There  are sadly many sick people in this world (including your peers) who will walk all over you if given the chance. Dont give them the chance.      Rule 12: one thing I learned quickly in my 6 years of college is very rarely should you listen to the opinions of others when it comes to who is a bad (most likely the adjective horrible or terrible are used) professor. Most times the people who say they had a bad experience are the ones who are not applying themselves in class, or who think this is high school and their prof told them no to raising their 89.4 to a 90 when it clearly states no rounding in the syllabus.      Rule 14: before you ask your professor a silly ass question, READ THE SYLLABUS. 99.99% of the time the answer you seek is in there. To go along with this, never start an email/conversation with I know it say *blank* in the syllabus, but& Just FYI it says *blank* in the syllabus for a reason, so dont ask.      Rule 15: if youre sick, stay home. College is already  a cesspool of disease and illness, dont bring your known germs into the classroom and get everyone sick. Communicate with your professors and 7-8/10 times they wont care that you missed class. To go with this (and anyone familiar with puke girl on the 2023 snap story), if youre constantly sick please go see a doctor. Listen and be respectful of their time and services even if you have to wait a long time. This is a shot at puke girl (sorry!) but NEVER let your STEM/nursing friends treat you. Just go see a doctor.       Rule 16: guys, respect the women. Youre not impressing anyone.       AND FINALLY, for all of the (international) freshman who have a 9.47 GPA, 12795 SAT, started an orphanage for disadvantaged children, cured cancer, and solved world hunger by inventing a self sustaining floating farm&Rule 17: yes youll more than likely get into the honors college.      For anyone that made it this far I hope you enjoyed my list of tips, tricks, and rules. I think this could be a fun thing to keep adding to so feel free to comment your own rules!

Communicate with your professors and 7-8/10 times they wont care that you missed class. To go with this (and anyone familiar with puke girl on the 2023 snap story), if youre constantly sick please go see a doctor. Listen and be respectful of their time and services even if you have to wait a long time. This is a shot at puke girl (sorry!) but NEVER let your STEM/nursing friends treat you. Just go see a doctor.       Rule 16: guys, respect the women. Youre not impressing anyone.       AND FINALLY, for all of the (international) freshman who have a 9.47 GPA, 12795 SAT, started an orphanage for disadvantaged children, cured cancer, and solved world hunger by inventing a self sustaining floating farm&Rule 17: yes youll more than likely get into the honors college.      For anyone that made it this far I hope you enjoyed my list of tips, tricks, and rules. I think this could be a fun thing to keep adding to so feel free to comment your own rules! I think its obvious, but satire and sarcasm are always welcome on this post.

I've been lurking this subreddit for perhaps 2 months now, and I think it's about time I made my own thread for help and advice. To start, I am 34 years old, black, and have been considering leaving the U.S. I first thought about it last year. The Buffalo massacre really got to me -- I almost didn't go to my own graduation because of it. I was so infuriated, as some of the victims could have been my own mother. Now we have what happened at MSU. There is something seriously wrong with our culture (I think it's one of hatred), and sometimes I wonder if it's just me going crazy. Am I consuming too much media? I do not think it is going to get better.      I live in a non-diverse college town on the east coast that houses a PWI. The other day, I visited a local bar and was speaking with an acquaintance (older white guy) that grew up during a time when things were still segregated. I mentioned during our conversation that I didn't grow up in a white neighborhood, and didn't really interact with white students until middle school (my middle school was pretty diverse). He then goes ""Did you get smarter then?"" You know, because the only way black people are intelligent is if they hang around white people (/s).       That guy's thinking is the same kind of hatred that permeates American society and fuels this country's division. There are people that think just like him that hold positions of power that seriously affect people's lives. What kind of society do you expect to have with people in positions of power that have that level of bias? I digress -- that's not what this thread is about, but I wanted to provide some context for why I am making this thread and considering leaving. Obviously, I want out. The USA isn't the only country in the world. There has to be place where I'm seen as a human first, and not ""black"" or ""black guy"" before anything else. I have traveled outside of the country before, but I have never *lived* in another country. I have been to London, Toronto, Japan, and Aruba by myself.      My field/background is education (most recently edtech) and I have almost a decade of experience in teaching. I've taught in K-8 public education (primarily upper elementary and 6th grade math), and my most recent teaching experience has been teaching (adjuncting) math content courses for education majors/preservice teachers at this university. I have a PhD in education with a specialization in mathematics education from a pretty good university here. I graduated last year.      However, I've been really struggling to find a job and I have student loan debt. I had a job that wasn't the right one for me last year, and I left it in November after working there for 10 months. People will say it's a dumb decision to do so, but I wasn't doing what I was hired to do, more work was getting added onto my plate without a bump in salary, and the company had no long-term plan or goals. They were totally winging it. I was also heavily micromanaged. I've been struggling to find a job since, and getting rejected for jobs I am definitely qualified to do. Other than student loan debt, I don't have any other obligations. I don't have any kids, no wife/not married, and I do not own a home.       I do not think or know if any of this matters, but most people would describe me as friendly. I like to play the ukulele and guitar, video games, and am very good at cooking. I'm an introvert at my core but also a bit of an ambivert. I love to socialize with others and learn from others' experiences.      Is there anyone that can help in terms of the following:      * Countries that I might want to look into and consider moving to? EU? Asia? Any places that might interest me? I am willing to learn a new language. In fact, that fascinates me.   * Any resources that can help me get started? I'm primarily concerned about employment and work/life balance, retirement, culture, citizenship, etc.?   * Should I pay off my student loan debt here first before moving?

579,2/14/2023,1676383028,Please give this a read this morning.,"Good morning, fellow Spartans.      As my flair suggests, Im an educator and as sad as it is to say, Ive had a lot of training on events like these. In fact, most of my educational training these last few years is trauma informed. Thats not to say Im an expert at all - just to say I wanted to share some of my insight as we process the events of last night.      What many of you are likely feeling this morning, and last night is called trauma, and your trauma is real. Some individuals have debated the gravity of this event compared to others, but that does very little to help the conversation. There was likely a moment where you felt out of control, deliberating anxiety, fearful for your friends, family, community members, or yourself. These feelings are real, these feelings are valid, and these feelings are likely not over in the waking hours. You may also feel like you are fine now, but then confused later when anxiety surprises you suddenly.      Address these feelings, in whatever way you need to. Some of us need to vent, some need to be alone, and some are touch and go as emotions are still high. Take controlled breaths, go to the gym, stay outside in the warm sun, or inside near a window. Read a book, play some games, call friends or family, try a new recipe, go out to lunch - do whatever you need to take care of you.      Try to avoid taking care of others until you are sure that your headspace is clear. As they say on airplanes, put on your own oxygen mask before attempting to assist others.      Id love for this thread to remain a place for Spartans to talk through their emotions, share social emotional wellness resources, or to just listen. Whatever you need, remember - your are cared for, your are loved, and you are safe.      Im here if anyone needs anything, and knowing our other mods - theyre likely here for you as well, in whatever capacity they can.      \-Chris      &amp;#x200B;      **Resources:**      * [Crisis resources being offered via phone, or in person.](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/11220w9/crisis_resources/) \-u/mrsjonas   * [Previous megathread with traditional campus resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/j2zyj0/feeling_down_here_are_some_resources/)   * [Mindfulness meditation](https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/mindfulness-meditation-to-control-pain)\- Harvard Health   * [Controlled breathing techniques](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/relaxation-techniques-breath-control-helps-quell-errant-stress-response) \- Harvard Health   * [Take a walk across the sites of MSU](https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/1128h2a/event214_200_pm_400pm_take_the_garden_walk_wave/)",msu,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/1125z4b/please_give_this_a_read_this_morning/,2/14/23 13:57,"Please give this a read this morning.

538,2/22/2023,1677098636,Reflections on teaching the day after at Michigan State University,"I am a split-position faculty+staff member at MSU. I thought I would write some reflections to share here about my own experiences returning to campus and teaching after the February 13th shooting on our campus. These reflections are purely my own. I want to emphasize that everyone has different reactions and processes traumatic events or injustice in their own way, and my experiences may not resonate with others.       \-Going back to work.      The reason I went back to work is because I care about and value my students - as otherwise, the job is absolutely not worth it. They are wonderful human beings, compassionate, gracious, kind, smart, and young activists. I am not expressing bland positivity here  I dont particularly like many students, but the ones I'm privileged to work with have values and goals that I think are important for our community and world. They are what make the job worth it, and seeing them in class is what is keeping me going. Their response and strength has been incredible.       \-We dont have time to process and respond to one injustice/trauma before getting overwhelmed with another.      From the pandemic, to the faÃ§ade of a return to normalcy, to continuing racial injustice in the country, to a literal insurrection at our nations Capitol, to worsening economic conditions virtually everywhere, to ever-increasing catastrophe from climate change, it feels like a barrage of trauma and injustice that leaves us with no time to process or rebuild before yet another occurs. At MSU, over the past few years weve had the community trauma from the Nassar sexual abuse (plus just last month we got a public report that highlighted how sexual violence is a continuing issue here particularly for vulnerable groups), multiple high-profile incidents of racial bias and harassment, our president leaving last semester during another controversy, and now this mass shooting. Fuck this neverending shit.       \-The burden from university leadership is constantly shifted to the frontline faculty/staff workers.      In the days following the shooting, university leadership has given speeches and held events, and some of what theyve said is thoughtful, but my own perception is that the focus has been too much on protecting the brand/identity of the university.       However, in terms of the university response about going forward, there has not been much specific guidance. Students are promised grace and flexibility as the semester continues from their faculty, and they have moved all classes out of the buildings that saw gunshots. But as faculty, weve been given little direction as to how to accommodate this grace and flexibility. The response reminds me so much of COVID-19, where the burden of work was shifted to the frontline workers, the faculty and staff who keep the university and classes running. It feels like we are left to figure it out for what the response will be. Weve had events about teaching the day after an event like this and they have been helpful for processing how to return to the classroom and talk to students, but that is only one segment of rebuilding for this semester and beyond.      The university-wide email to faculty told us You should feel confident in adjusting syllabus expectations as needed. The university response  Just update your syllabus!  reflects the disconnect between administration, and the people who teach and support students.       This is highlighted by the fact (as some posts have noted on this sub) that some faculty have been incredibly insensitive in returning right to content, exams, and requirements for attendance. I already knew this from working with some such faculty, but some of them lost a sense of compassion somewhere in their lives, probably during their PhD when it was beaten out of them. Academia is overflowing with bullying, abuse, presumed meritocracy, and detachment from reality, and during events like this, it shows.      \-The numbness and sense of inevitability of injustice - yet the need for activism and disruptive protest      With the rate of mass shooting in the US, I always viewed it as a distinct possibility that one would happen near me, and have thought about it at some point almost every time Ive taught a class. I also teach politically-charged topics, and have viewed being targeted as a distinct possibility.       Stand at a busy intersection, and you will likely inevitably see an accident. Live in the US, you may eventually experience a shooting. It does not make it any less horrifying or scary, but this reality has left me with a sense of numbness, like this was unsurprising  when this should be shocking, terrifying, and surprising, because it (should) rarely ever happen, like in so many other places where this is in fact a rarity.       I am massively in favor of gun control and my ideal would be to live in a place with few guns, in addition to a robust social support network including universal healthcare, workers' rights, labor unions, and high pay for teachers/mental health workers/childcare workers/elderly workers, and all the other truly essential jobs that create the fabric of our of society.       I think what brings me the most anger is the amount of people who rush to the defense of guns/gun ownership no matter the frequency and scale of the violence caused by them in the US  particularly in a state like Michigan where it is part of the shitty culture here. Part of my life goal is to prevent and undo the damage such people, policies, and laws create - as well as to highlight in my teaching and advocacy on campus that overwhelming research shows that gun control works. Fuck your guns. Our lives matter more.

In the days following the shooting, university leadership has given speeches and held events, and some of what theyve said is thoughtful, but my own perception is that the focus has been too much on protecting the brand/identity of the university.       However, in terms of the university response about going forward, there has not been much specific guidance. Students are promised grace and flexibility as the semester continues from their faculty, and they have moved all classes out of the buildings that saw gunshots. But as faculty, weve been given little direction as to how to accommodate this grace and flexibility. The response reminds me so much of COVID-19, where the burden of work was shifted to the frontline workers, the faculty and staff who keep the university and classes running. It feels like we are left to figure it out for what the response will be. Weve had events about teaching the day after an event like this and they have been helpful for processing how to return to the classroom and talk to students, but that is only one segment of rebuilding for this semester and beyond.      The university-wide email to faculty told us You should feel confident in adjusting syllabus expectations as needed. The university response  Just update your syllabus!  reflects the disconnect between administration, and the people who teach and support students.       This is highlighted by the fact (as some posts have noted on this sub) that some faculty have been incredibly insensitive in returning right to content, exams, and requirements for attendance. I already knew this from working with some such faculty, but some of them lost a sense of compassion somewhere in their lives, probably during their PhD when it was beaten out of them. Academia is overflowing with bullying, abuse, presumed meritocracy, and detachment from reality, and during events like this, it shows.      \-The numbness and sense of inevitability of injustice - yet the need for activism and disruptive protest      With the rate of mass shooting in the US, I always viewed it as a distinct possibility that one would happen near me, and have thought about it at some point almost every time Ive taught a class. I also teach politically-charged topics, and have viewed being targeted as a distinct possibility.       Stand at a busy intersection, and you will likely inevitably see an accident. Live in the US, you may eventually experience a shooting. It does not make it any less horrifying or scary, but this reality has left me with a sense of numbness, like this was unsurprising  when this should be shocking, terrifying, and surprising, because it (should) rarely ever happen, like in so many other places where this is in fact a rarity.       I am massively in favor of gun control and my ideal would be to live in a place with few guns, in addition to a robust social support network including universal healthcare, workers' rights, labor unions, and high pay for teachers/mental health workers/childcare workers/elderly workers, and all the other truly essential jobs that create the fabric of our of society.       I think what brings me the most anger is the amount of people who rush to the defense of guns/gun ownership no matter the frequency and scale of the violence caused by them in the US  particularly in a state like Michigan where it is part of the shitty culture here. Part of my life goal is to prevent and undo the damage such people, policies, and laws create - as well as to highlight in my teaching and advocacy on campus that overwhelming research shows that gun control works.

I thought I would write some reflections to share here about my own experiences returning to campus and teaching after the February 13th shooting on our campus. These reflections are purely my own. I want to emphasize that everyone has different reactions and processes traumatic events or injustice in their own way, and my experiences may not resonate with others.       \-Going back to work.      The reason I went back to work is because I care about and value my students - as otherwise, the job is absolutely not worth it. They are wonderful human beings, compassionate, gracious, kind, smart, and young activists. I am not expressing bland positivity here  I dont particularly like many students, but the ones I'm privileged to work with have values and goals that I think are important for our community and world. They are what make the job worth it, and seeing them in class is what is keeping me going. Their response and strength has been incredible.       \-We dont have time to process and respond to one injustice/trauma before getting overwhelmed with another.      From the pandemic, to the faÃ§ade of a return to normalcy, to continuing racial injustice in the country, to a literal insurrection at our nations Capitol, to worsening economic conditions virtually everywhere, to ever-increasing catastrophe from climate change, it feels like a barrage of trauma and injustice that leaves us with no time to process or rebuild before yet another occurs.

453,2/13/2023,1676327944,Bubble Watch,"Welcome to the first edition of the 2023 College Hockey Bubble Watch! This is modeled off Eamonn Brennan's series for college basketball in The Athletic. There are three categories of teams in Bubble Watch; Locks, Should Be In, and Work to Do. Locks are any team that would still be in the field even if they lose every game left on their schedule. Should Be In are any team that would feel comfortable even if they finish poorly down the stretch, and Work to Do is any team that needs to win more games to be safely in the field of 16. Of course college hockey selects its tournament field based off the Pairwise rankings, rather than college basketball's selection committee. Odds of making the tournament are pulled from [PlayoffStatus.com](https://playoffstatus.com).           #**Atlantic Hockey**   Since its founding in 2003, Atlantic Hockey has only had two teams in the tournament once, in 2013, when Canisius got the auto-bid and Niagara earned an at large. AIC has been the representative in the last three tournaments, but the Yellowjackets sit third at this point in the conference standings and 41st in the Pairwise. RIT leads the conference but has less than a 1% chance of earning an at-large bid. As such, nobody from AHA is on Bubble Watch and the conference will once again be represented by their tournament champion alone.            #**Big Ten**     The Big Ten has traditionally been seen as tied for the second best conference behind the NCHC, but is clearly the nation's top league this season. The conference has three locks in Minnesota, Michigan, and Penn State and six of the seven members sit in the top 16 of the Pairwise currently. Minnesota has sat at the top of the Pairwise for several weeks now and is poised to claim the top seed in the tournament. Michigan's strong non-conference scheduled buoyed their Pairwise while the Wolverines struggled in conference play, but have since rattled off seven straight wins, including a sweep over rivals Michigan State this weekend. Penn State played a very week non-conference slate, but went 10-0, bolstering their RPI and securing a spot in the field when combined with the tough Big Ten schedule.         **Locks:** Minnesota, Michigan, Penn State     **Should Be In:** Ohio State     **Work to Do:** Michigan State, Notre Dame        **Ohio State (17-11-2, PWR: 9, At Large Odds: 85%):** Ohio State collapsed last season at the end, costing themselves a tournament bid, but this year's Buckeyes are looking to avoid a similar fate. They do finish the regular season with series against Michigan and Minnesota, but Ohio State has earned splits against both earlier in the season. Earning a home Big Ten Tournament series will likely require 3-5 points.        **Michigan State (15-15-2, PWR: 14, At Large Odds: 33%):** New coach Adam Nightingale has the Spartans in tournament contention in mid-February for the first time since the beginning of the Anastos era. Getting swept by Michigan this past weekend did not help the cause. MSU will likely need to sweep Wisconsin this upcoming weekend in their final regular season series and win a first round conference tournament series to make the field.        **Notre Dame (14-14-4, PWR: 16, At Large Odds: 32%):** The Fighting Irish bounced back from a devastating road sweep at the hands of Michigan State to get a win and a tie against Ohio State this past weekend to get themselves back in the conversation. ND is currently the first team out of the field. Staying at .500 to maintain eligibility for an at-large bid is tantamount, but they finish their regular season in two weeks against Michigan at Yost. Getting a split is key.           #**CCHA:**       The sophomore season of the new CCHA doesn't have a contender for a top seed, as it did last year in Minnesota State, but it does have a chance at being a multi-bid league once again. The conference's non-conference winning percentage is down significantly from .478 to .429, damaging the RPI of the teams on the bubble.        **Work To Do:** Michigan Tech, Minnesota State        **Michigan Tech (21-8-4, PWR: 12, At Large Odds: 50%):** Tech has been on a tear in the last three weeks, winning five of six to keep pace with Minnesota State at the top of the CCHA standings. Non-conference wins over Michigan State in the GLI Consolation and Boston University bolster a relatively weak strength of schedule (30th) for a bubble team. The Huskies will likely need to make a run in the CCHA Tournament to earn a second straight trip to the NCAAs.        **Minnesota State (19-10-1, PWR: 13, At Large Odds: 27%):** Coming off a devastating loss in the national championship to Denver last year, the Mavericks have not been able to quite replicate the dominance they have shown in recent seasons.  They've been good in conference play, but were swept at home by Bemidji State and Ferris State. They do have a non-conference win over Minnesota, but were swept by St. Cloud State. They are in prime position to win the CCHA once again, but will likely need to sweep, or at minimum split with, Michigan Tech to be in a good position going into the conference tournament.          #**ECAC**     The Ivies taking a year off continues to hurt the ECAC's strength as a conference, as only Cornell and Harvard have recovered to compete nationally. Quinnipiac, however, has dominated the conference, dropping only two games and one in non-conference to Maine and is in position to get a one seed. The Bobcats are ECAC's only lock, but they do have two other teams in contention for bids.        **Locks:** Quinnipiac   **Should Be In:** Cornell, Harvard        **Cornell (16-7-2, PWR: 10, At Large Odds: 72%):** The Big Red have been very good in ECAC play, but played a relatively weak non-conference schedule, though they could not have predicted Minnesota-Duluth being so average this season (they did get swept by the Bulldogs, however). They have clinched a first round bye in the ECAC tournament, thus avoiding the risk of a loss to a very bad team. Finishing the regular season undefeated (home against Clarkson and St. Lawrence, away at Brown and Yale) would go a long way, and is entirely doable.        **Harvard (17-6-1, PWR: 11, At Large Odds: 67%):** The Crimson have their eye on a Beanpot title tonight against Northeastern, but are also in good shape for their second straight NCAA appearance. Like Cornell, they don't face any of the big dogs in the ECAC down the stretch, but losing a couple could drop Harvard from relatively safe to in danger. For now, they have a good shot of making the field.            #**Hockey East:**      Hockey East once had six teams in the projected field in the middle of December, but is now down to only two if the tournament started today. It's been a collapse that basically nobody saw coming, and saw UMass and Merrimack fall from the top 10 and top 3, respectively, to off the bubble entirely. It's still slightly possible for Merrimack, Providence, and UMass-Lowell to make the field, but their play lately does not garner any confidence that they will do so and so are not included.      **Should Be In:** Boston University      **Work To Do:** Northeastern, UConn      **Boston University (20-7, PWR: 4, At Large Odds 61%):** The Terriers non-conference slate boasts wins over Michigan, Notre Dame, Harvard, and Cornell, and they have won 7 in a row in HEA play, but they just have too many games remaining to be a lock. BU will more than likely be in the field come Selection Saturday. This weekend's series against Merrimack could seal the deal.        **Northeastern (14-10-4, PWR: 15, At Large Odds: 23%):** Northeastern has been good in Hockey East play, but a terrible performance in non-conference, including losses to Union, Sacred Heart, and Bentley, keep them on the edge of the tournament field. The only likely tournament team they will play down the stretch of the regular season is Harvard tonight in the Beanpot final. A win would do a great deal for their bubble hopes.        **UConn (17-10-3, PWR: 18, At Large Odds: 14%):** One of the early darlings of the season, UConn has since fallen off a cliff. Getting swept by New Hampshire this past weekend did not help at all. The Huskies don't have any team with more than 11 wins left on their schedule and so will need to win out and pick up at least one conference tournament win to make the field.           #**NCHC**     The nation's best conference for the past few years is having a down year, but will have at least three, if not four bids to the tournament. Both North Dakota and Minnesota-Duluth are off the bubble for the first time in years, though Western Michigan's resurgence has somewhat made up for it.         **Should Be In:** Denver, St. Cloud State, Western Michigan     **Work to Do:** Nebraska-Omaha        **Denver (23-7-0, PWR: 5, At Large Odds: 65%):** The reigning national champions are cruising in NCHC play, having been swept only once, and currently holding an eight point lead. A relatively tough non-conference schedule has the Pios in a very good position, just outside the one seeds as things stand. A series at Western Michigan in a couple weeks will likely determine if Denver is a lock or not going into the NCHC tournament.        **St. Cloud State (18-8-2, PWR: 7, At Large Odds: 75%):** St. Cloud was great in non-conference play, but have dropped some NCHC games they shouldn't have, including to Miami and Colorado College. The Huskies finish with three series against the middle of the conference.        **Western Michigan (19-10-1, PWR: 8, At Large Odds: 76%):** WMU boasts the most productive forward line in college hockey, which includes Hobey Baker favorite Jason Polin. A loss to Alaska-Anchorage isn't great for the resume, but they have enough NCHC wins to be safely in the field right now.        **Nebraska-Omaha (15-10-3, PWR: 17, At Large Odds: 27%):** Omaha is used to being on the bubble in recent series and they find themselves in the thick of it again this year. They have a sweep of Western Michigan on the resume and an upcoming series against St. Cloud State that could really help their chances. Getting swept by Niagara on opening weekend is not great.           #**Independents**   Its fairly rare that an independent has a shot at a bid, but there is one team that has one this year.        **Work To Do:** Alaska        **Alaska (16-10-2, PWR: 19, At Large Odds: 11%):** The Nanooks have a terrible SOS, but splits with Denver, Notre Dame, and Michigan Tech have given them a shot of making the field for only the third time ever and first since 2010. They will have to win out against Long Island, Arizona State, and Lindenwood after dropping a game to LIU this past weekend, but it is possible.",collegehockey,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegehockey/comments/111mb1i/bubble_watch/,2/13/23 22:39,"Bubble Watch Welcome to the first edition of the 2023 College Hockey Bubble Watch!

BU will more than likely be in the field come Selection Saturday. This weekend's series against Merrimack could seal the deal.        **Northeastern (14-10-4, PWR: 15, At Large Odds: 23%):** Northeastern has been good in Hockey East play, but a terrible performance in non-conference, including losses to Union, Sacred Heart, and Bentley, keep them on the edge of the tournament field. The only likely tournament team they will play down the stretch of the regular season is Harvard tonight in the Beanpot final. A win would do a great deal for their bubble hopes.        **UConn (17-10-3, PWR: 18, At Large Odds: 14%):** One of the early darlings of the season, UConn has since fallen off a cliff. Getting swept by New Hampshire this past weekend did not help at all. The Huskies don't have any team with more than 11 wins left on their schedule and so will need to win out and pick up at least one conference tournament win to make the field.           #**NCHC**     The nation's best conference for the past few years is having a down year, but will have at least three, if not four bids to the tournament. Both North Dakota and Minnesota-Duluth are off the bubble for the first time in years, though Western Michigan's resurgence has somewhat made up for it.         **Should Be In:** Denver, St. Cloud State, Western Michigan     **Work to Do:** Nebraska-Omaha        **Denver (23-7-0, PWR: 5, At Large Odds: 65%):** The reigning national champions are cruising in NCHC play, having been swept only once, and currently holding an eight point lead. A relatively tough non-conference schedule has the Pios in a very good position, just outside the one seeds as things stand. A series at Western Michigan in a couple weeks will likely determine if Denver is a lock or not going into the NCHC tournament.        **St. Cloud State (18-8-2, PWR: 7, At Large Odds: 75%):** St. Cloud was great in non-conference play, but have dropped some NCHC games they shouldn't have, including to Miami and Colorado College. The Huskies finish with three series against the middle of the conference.        **Western Michigan (19-10-1, PWR: 8, At Large Odds: 76%):** WMU boasts the most productive forward line in college hockey, which includes Hobey Baker favorite Jason Polin. A loss to Alaska-Anchorage isn't great for the resume, but they have enough NCHC wins to be safely in the field right now.        **Nebraska-Omaha (15-10-3, PWR: 17, At Large Odds: 27%):** Omaha is used to being on the bubble in recent series and they find themselves in the thick of it again this year. They have a sweep of Western Michigan on the resume and an upcoming series against St. Cloud State that could really help their chances. Getting swept by Niagara on opening weekend is not great.           #**Independents**   Its fairly rare that an independent has a shot at a bid, but there is one team that has one this year.        **Work To Do:** Alaska        **Alaska (16-10-2, PWR: 19, At Large Odds: 11%):** The Nanooks have a terrible SOS, but splits with Denver, Notre Dame, and Michigan Tech have given them a shot of making the field for only the third time ever and first since 2010. They will have to win out against Long Island, Arizona State, and Lindenwood after dropping a game to LIU this past weekend, but it is possible.",954,0.078616352,0.105870021,0.184486373,0.006289308,0.012578616,0.018867925,0.002096436,0.042976939,0.045073375,0.006289308,0.110062893,0.071278826,0.181341719,64,54,0.01048218,0.999,Ruiling,Neutral

I was about two buildings away from the shooting when it started, meaning that I heard the shots, screams, and sirens.  For four hours I hid in my closet, crying on the phone with my parents and sister.  I was never in any real danger past the first moments (I was close enough for stray bullets to theoretically be a concern), but the police scanners we were all listening to made it seem like there were multiple shooters in all parts of campus.  We thought it was a mass terrorism event, and I had to come to terms with the fact that the police were saying that there was a shooter on the same floor of the same building as some of my friends.  I didn't know if I was ever going to see them again or even get to come home.      Two weeks on, I can't think.  I feel like a fog has settled over my brain.  I have a hard time typing out sentences, let alone doing advanced math or writing a paper.  Any assignment feels overwhelming, but I can't take a break from school because I will lose my scholarship.  I'm in therapy, but there's only so much you can do on a zoom call that's not technically even supposed to be happening because you're out of state.  I shake uncontrollably at random times and can't watch a lot of the shows that I like because they have gun violence and sirens in them.  I can't stop thinking about the what ifs and whys (why wasn't it me, it could have been me). I have to bike past the places where people died every day.  I just want everything to stop, but everything has to keep going because other people have lives too.      I guess my question is how do I even start to heal?  I've looked into trauma therapy, but there's so much discourse on whether or not things like EMDR even work that I can't sift through it all.  Our psych services are overloaded with traumatized kids, so that's a no-go.  My profs are super nice and are giving grace on assignments, but if this lasts for more than two weeks more (after spring break), I'm not sure if that will be the case anymore.  I can't take a semester off because I'm only here on scholarship and that goes away if I drop.  I can't just stop my classes because I need grad school.  I can't go home early because I have a lab job that people need me to do, and if I somehow can swing it, then I'm just miserable in another state.  I feel like my life has been ripped away from me.  My parents keep telling me that I've gotta move on, and while I know they're right, it feels like telling someone they have to finish a marathon while that person is stuck in quicksand.  I'm mentally exhausted and everyone knows it.

     &amp;#x200B;      This is one of the best courses of action that we have at the moment, so please make your voices heard!      Edit: Here is my email, I attempted to take a very centrist stance in hopes of pulling more democrats closer to the center.             Hello,      I hope you are all doing well. I am  a very concerned lifetime Michigan resident and gun owner, so I wanted  to take the time to write to you all in hopes that I can sway at least  one of you towards proposing bills that will actually make a difference  in Michigan.            The three initial gun control  bills proposed (red flag laws, safe storage laws, and ""universal""  background checks) unfortunately will do nothing to address the state of  crime and mass shootings anywhere in the country, let alone Michigan.  The tragedies that occurred at Oxford High School and Michigan State  University would not have been prevented if these laws were already on  the books. The Oxford shooter was a mentally ill child who was handed a  weapon by his negligent parents who deserve punishment just as severe as  the shooter himself, and the MSU shooter was a criminal who was  supposed to have felony charges on his record but did not due to a lapse  in judgement by county officials years back. How would any of these  laws have changed anything? Safely storing firearms is a practice that  the vast majority of responsible gun owners already perform and is a  simply unenforceable law unless certain rights are to be waived. Red  flag laws are a direct infringement upon one's constitutional right to  due process, to say the very least, and open the door to abuse via  racial profiling and retaliation, among others. Universal background  checks simply do not make sense because we already have a background  check system when purchasing firearms from an FFL dealer, and firearms  that are traded/purchased between **legal and responsible** gun  owners are rarely the issue, it is typically criminals and criminal  transactions that need the proper attention from law enforcement. We  face a list of unique problems in Michigan, none of which will be  addressed by the proposition of this legislation.      Further  legislation that is being pushed, namely legislation that makes it  almost impossible for CPL holders to carry their firearms anywhere, will  only serve to worsen one of the primary issues we face; crime.  Furthermore, laws like this will disproportionately affect minorities  and those living in lower to middle class areas, where **legally**  concealing a firearm is essential to one's safety. These areas have  little to no police presence due to a lack of funding, overextension, or  most commonly both. As the child of an immigrant I have first hand  exposure to these areas of Michigan, as I was born and raised in Metro  Detroit and have experienced just how dangerous some areas can be.  Proposing bills to make it more difficult for **legal and responsible** gun  owners to purchase and carry firearms is a massive step in the wrong  direction, seeing as the vast majority of these legal gun owners are  unable to afford private security teams adequately armed to protect them  and their families whenever and wherever necessary.      If  the Michigan legislature wishes to pass legislation that will actually  make a difference in the state, especially concerning the topic of gun  crime, perhaps a great place to start would be to tackle the poverty  issue our state faces. Our metropolitan areas, namely cities like  Detroit and Flint, are among the most dangerous cities in the country.  I've unfortunately witnessed schools that were boarded up and closed in  Detroit, a lack of resources for the community, a lack of community  centers to help the children and provide outside of school education and  care, a lack of nutritional food choices, a lack of proper healthcare  both mental and physical, a lack of proper infrastructure, and more that  I am probably forgetting at the moment. Myself along with many others  have heard so many politicians claiming to be champions of the poor and  disenfranchised, including our current governor, but we have yet to see  any real change at the very source, at the root of our issues in this  state. The intense focus on ""gun control"" is posturing at the very  least, unconstitutional and treasonous at most especially when there are  so many other areas that we need to shift the focus to.      We  have unique issues here in Michigan, the improper flow of taxpayer  funds and corporate backed politicians topping the list. The laws  proposed would have done absolutely nothing to prevent the tragedies  that occurred, and will most likely do nothing to prevent any future  tragedies should they occur. There are steps you could all take to  tackle the root of the issue, regardless of party.      I  implore you all to set your party aside and rethink the proposed bills,  for the sake of this state and its people, and propose bills that will  actually make a difference in Michigan from the ground up.

     &amp;#x200B;      This is one of the best courses of action that we have at the moment, so please make your voices heard!      Edit: Here is my email, I attempted to take a very centrist stance in hopes of pulling more democrats closer to the center.             Hello,      I hope you are all doing well. I am  a very concerned lifetime Michigan resident and gun owner, so I wanted  to take the time to write to you all in hopes that I can sway at least  one of you towards proposing bills that will actually make a difference  in Michigan.            The three initial gun control  bills proposed (red flag laws, safe storage laws, and ""universal""  background checks) unfortunately will do nothing to address the state of  crime and mass shootings anywhere in the country, let alone Michigan.  The tragedies that occurred at Oxford High School and Michigan State  University would not have been prevented if these laws were already on  the books. The Oxford shooter was a mentally ill child who was handed a  weapon by his negligent parents who deserve punishment just as severe as  the shooter himself, and the MSU shooter was a criminal who was  supposed to have felony charges on his record but did not due to a lapse  in judgement by county officials years back. How would any of these  laws have changed anything? Safely storing firearms is a practice that  the vast majority of responsible gun owners already perform and is a  simply unenforceable law unless certain rights are to be waived. Red  flag laws are a direct infringement upon one's constitutional right to  due process, to say the very least, and open the door to abuse via  racial profiling and retaliation, among others. Universal background  checks simply do not make sense because we already have a background  check system when purchasing firearms from an FFL dealer, and firearms  that are traded/purchased between **legal and responsible** gun  owners are rarely the issue, it is typically criminals and criminal  transactions that need the proper attention from law enforcement. We  face a list of unique problems in Michigan, none of which will be  addressed by the proposition of this legislation.      Further  legislation that is being pushed, namely legislation that makes it  almost impossible for CPL holders to carry their firearms anywhere, will  only serve to worsen one of the primary issues we face; crime.  Furthermore, laws like this will disproportionately affect minorities  and those living in lower to middle class areas, where **legally**  concealing a firearm is essential to one's safety. These areas have  little to no police presence due to a lack of funding, overextension, or  most commonly both. As the child of an immigrant I have first hand  exposure to these areas of Michigan, as I was born and raised in Metro  Detroit and have experienced just how dangerous some areas can be.  Proposing bills to make it more difficult for **legal and responsible** gun  owners to purchase and carry firearms is a massive step in the wrong  direction, seeing as the vast majority of these legal gun owners are  unable to afford private security teams adequately armed to protect them  and their families whenever and wherever necessary.      If  the Michigan legislature wishes to pass legislation that will actually  make a difference in the state, especially concerning the topic of gun  crime, perhaps a great place to start would be to tackle the poverty  issue our state faces. Our metropolitan areas, namely cities like  Detroit and Flint, are among the most dangerous cities in the country.  I've unfortunately witnessed schools that were boarded up and closed in  Detroit, a lack of resources for the community, a lack of community  centers to help the children and provide outside of school education and  care, a lack of nutritional food choices, a lack of proper healthcare  both mental and physical, a lack of proper infrastructure, and more that  I am probably forgetting at the moment. Myself along with many others  have heard so many politicians claiming to be champions of the poor and  disenfranchised, including our current governor, but we have yet to see  any real change at the very source, at the root of our issues in this  state. The intense focus on ""gun control"" is posturing at the very  least, unconstitutional and treasonous at most especially when there are  so many other areas that we need to shift the focus to.      We  have unique issues here in Michigan, the improper flow of taxpayer  funds and corporate backed politicians topping the list. The laws  proposed would have done absolutely nothing to prevent the tragedies  that occurred, and will most likely do nothing to prevent any future  tragedies should they occur. There are steps you could all take to  tackle the root of the issue, regardless of party.      I  implore you all to set your party aside and rethink the proposed bills,  for the sake of this state and its people, and propose bills that will  actually make a difference in Michigan from the ground up.

Mrs Howson had already fled the US to Thailand on January 3rd.      She stayed in her home in Chonburi, Eastern Thailand from January 5th, when she arrived, until February 8th when the pressure from news reports became too much.  Than she fled to the Western Thailand, near the border with Myanmar (Burma) before giving herself up to the Thai police.  She was near the Myanmar border because she was wanting to flee Thailand to escape arrest.      This is where it gets interesting...  The Thai police caught her and gave a big press conference with a high ranking police officer.  They told her side of the story (she claims she thought she hit a deer and was in shock) and the police told the public, **they were not going to arrest her** (Even though the US has requested she be extradited back to the US.  The US and Thailand have an extradition treaty).  The police said she was willing to return to the United States and that **she would be on a plane before Sunday, 19 February.**  They said Ms Howson returning to the US on her own free will would be an example of the high morality of the Thai people.

     &amp;#x200B;      This is one of the best courses of action that we have at the moment, so please make your voices heard!      Edit: Here is my email, I attempted to take a very centrist stance in hopes of pulling more democrats closer to the center.             Hello,      I hope you are all doing well. I am  a very concerned lifetime Michigan resident and gun owner, so I wanted  to take the time to write to you all in hopes that I can sway at least  one of you towards proposing bills that will actually make a difference  in Michigan.            The three initial gun control  bills proposed (red flag laws, safe storage laws, and ""universal""  background checks) unfortunately will do nothing to address the state of  crime and mass shootings anywhere in the country, let alone Michigan.  The tragedies that occurred at Oxford High School and Michigan State  University would not have been prevented if these laws were already on  the books. The Oxford shooter was a mentally ill child who was handed a  weapon by his negligent parents who deserve punishment just as severe as  the shooter himself, and the MSU shooter was a criminal who was  supposed to have felony charges on his record but did not due to a lapse  in judgement by county officials years back. How would any of these  laws have changed anything? Safely storing firearms is a practice that  the vast majority of responsible gun owners already perform and is a  simply unenforceable law unless certain rights are to be waived. Red  flag laws are a direct infringement upon one's constitutional right to  due process, to say the very least, and open the door to abuse via  racial profiling and retaliation, among others. Universal background  checks simply do not make sense because we already have a background  check system when purchasing firearms from an FFL dealer, and firearms  that are traded/purchased between **legal and responsible** gun  owners are rarely the issue, it is typically criminals and criminal  transactions that need the proper attention from law enforcement. We  face a list of unique problems in Michigan, none of which will be  addressed by the proposition of this legislation.      Further  legislation that is being pushed, namely legislation that makes it  almost impossible for CPL holders to carry their firearms anywhere, will  only serve to worsen one of the primary issues we face; crime.  Furthermore, laws like this will disproportionately affect minorities  and those living in lower to middle class areas, where **legally**  concealing a firearm is essential to one's safety. These areas have  little to no police presence due to a lack of funding, overextension, or  most commonly both. As the child of an immigrant I have first hand  exposure to these areas of Michigan, as I was born and raised in Metro  Detroit and have experienced just how dangerous some areas can be.  Proposing bills to make it more difficult for **legal and responsible** gun  owners to purchase and carry firearms is a massive step in the wrong  direction, seeing as the vast majority of these legal gun owners are  unable to afford private security teams adequately armed to protect them  and their families whenever and wherever necessary.      If  the Michigan legislature wishes to pass legislation that will actually  make a difference in the state, especially concerning the topic of gun  crime, perhaps a great place to start would be to tackle the poverty  issue our state faces. Our metropolitan areas, namely cities like  Detroit and Flint, are among the most dangerous cities in the country.  I've unfortunately witnessed schools that were boarded up and closed in  Detroit, a lack of resources for the community, a lack of community  centers to help the children and provide outside of school education and  care, a lack of nutritional food choices, a lack of proper healthcare  both mental and physical, a lack of proper infrastructure, and more that  I am probably forgetting at the moment. Myself along with many others  have heard so many politicians claiming to be champions of the poor and  disenfranchised, including our current governor, but we have yet to see  any real change at the very source, at the root of our issues in this  state. The intense focus on ""gun control"" is posturing at the very  least, unconstitutional and treasonous at most especially when there are  so many other areas that we need to shift the focus to.      We  have unique issues here in Michigan, the improper flow of taxpayer  funds and corporate backed politicians topping the list. The laws  proposed would have done absolutely nothing to prevent the tragedies  that occurred, and will most likely do nothing to prevent any future  tragedies should they occur. There are steps you could all take to  tackle the root of the issue, regardless of party.      I  implore you all to set your party aside and rethink the proposed bills,  for the sake of this state and its people, and propose bills that will  actually make a difference in Michigan from the ground up.

No matter how I look at it, it is not rational to do your job well at this institution. Let me explain why:      Say that person 1 does their job well. Doesnt matter what that is: Reply to an email quickly. Send helpful information to a student. Write a strong report and submit it on time. Take professional development courses and implement what youve learned to improve your office. Join a committee and play a helpful role. Etc.      Heres the first thing that happens next: People see you doing something well (or even doing it at all), and so they go to you for those tasks when they need them again. Other people see that, and they go to you, too. You quickly become very busy, because people increasingly come to you with tasks.      Heres the next thing that happens. Inevitably people ask you to do things outside of your job. In some cases, this is your supervisor, so you often cant say no. But if you do them, eventually people start to view these as your responsibilities.       Ive been at MSU a few years. Good work has only ever been rewarded with *more work*. All of the people I've seen perform well in their jobs have ended up with responsibilities added on that go far beyond their position.       Now, consider the alternative, person 2: They dont do some job well. It could be anything: They dont reply to an email. They avoid students or give less than helpful replies. They submit reports late or do them poorly. They are a lackluster committee member. Etc.      Heres the first thing that happens next: People dont ask them to do those things anymore. (They ask person 1 instead, who did them well.) What also happens is that person 2 is not asked to do new things, or if they are and they do them not so well, they arent asked to again in the future.       Person 1 is overworked, unrewarded, and often the target of blame (because people around them associate them with all the tasks they are now responsible for  and if they arent done, well, who else has ever done them?). Person 2 has free time and lower responsibilities. The bar for decent work is set far lower for them as well.      You might immediately think, ok, but person 2 is eventually going to face consequences  maybe even lose their job, right? In my experience, absolutely not. In fact, the opposite happens to person 2. They have more free time at work, so they use that time to get ahead on some things that are beneficial to them. They use that time to apply to other jobs eventually, too, and sometimes get those jobs or promotions. They fail upwards, and theres a lot of it.      In my opinion, this dynamic is rampant at MSU. You might call it a free rider problem, but it isnt just about individuals, but also the institution.

49,2/6/2023,1675693079,Chaos Space Marine Legionaries - Iron Warriors,"**A simple question for the day - are Iron Warrior Legionaries a solid enough unit to build around?**       I think they could now be on par with Noise Marines, but that may be a controversial take!      * Chaos Space Marine Legionaries are an all-purpose obsec unit which can be kitted out to be all melee, all shooting, or a hybrid of both.    * They are also one of the few units that can take a Mark of Chaos and an Icon for the full benefit.    * With the latest points update, you get free upgrades on the unit bar the balefire tome.       Iron Warriors supplement the Legionaries further with:      1. The Iron Warriors legion trait provides a good durability boost against -1/-2 AP weapons. In addition the legion trait takes away cover save bonuses and hit modifiers from dense cover.    2. Good stratagems such as Dour Duty (*-1 dmg*), Spiteful Endurance (*5+++ FNP vs Mortal*s) and Cold-Hearted Malignity (*auto-pass morale+boost to hit rolls for remainder of the game*).    3. The Warlord Trait Implacable Taskmaster provides a 6'' aura of counting as having remained stationary. This means you can stock up on some Legionaries heavy weapons and still move up the field without penalty.      I think this all combines to make Iron Warriors Legionaries a viable build around. For example, a simple comparison is:      * 2 MSU Noise Marine Squads with Blastmaster, Icon and a Power Fist = 270 pts.    * 3 MSU Legionnaire Squads with Reaper Chaincannon, Icon, Power Fist and a Heavy Chainaxe = 270pts.       Now of course, you have to invest 1 CP into a Warlord Trait and the Legionaries are less effective vs heavier targets. However, it is not a bad comparison in my mind as Noise Marines are (were?) considered a great unit. You could of course also double down on the flexibility of Legionaries by taking the Mark of Tzeentch and bumping the squad up to 10 models for the extra heavy weapon or some Khorne Units.

435,3/6/2023,1678146074,the death of Karl Heikell,"11-year-old Karl Heikell lived with his sisters and parents in the small community of Centennial Heights Michigan. Centennial is near Calumet, a former UP boomtown.      On the afternoon of Halloween 1981 11-year-old Karl told his sister that he was heading out to a quote drinking party. He told his father that he was heading out on a walk. This was about 4p, sunset wouldnt happen for at least two and a half hours.      Karl would not return from his outing, whether it was to a drinking party like he told his sister, or if he went out for a walk like he told his father.      On November 1, his parents reported him missing to law enforcement. Unfortunately, police decided, as they often did during this era, that he was a runaway, they told the family not to worry, as Karl would turn up in a day or two at the family home.      On November 1, a man named Gary Olsen tells police that he knows Karl and saw him walking towards the ""BL"" home in Centennial Heights on Halloween, between 4 and 4:30PM. This lines up with what Karls family said about Karl departing around 4 or 4:30 that afternoon.      On December 2, 1981, police log a black Casio watch into evidence. The watch was found by a Centennial Heights local, on November 30, while he was walking County Road C-11A. The man noticed a watch face missing a wristband, laying in the road, on top of snow, and on the left side of the roadway.      Karl's father, Lawrence Heikell, confirmed the watch belonged to Karl. Police also note that the watch was found just east of the BL property in Centennial Heights, about 25 yards east of where the creek crosses the road if driving US-41. Ive mentioned the BL house twice now, we will get to the BL family shortly.      While weve found one of Karls belongings in an odd place  we still dont have any idea whats happened to Karl himself.      It will take almost a full year until we have some answers in Karls disappearance.      On October 2, 1982, Roger Perreault, a local bird hunter called law enforcement to report that while exploring a wooded area near Centennial Heights, he came across several articles of torn clothing. Roger along with his father, took police to the scene.      Upon arrival officers observed one pair of blue jeans, remnants of a blue and green plaid shirt, white socks with red trim, white underwear, and a blue nylon jacket. Additional searches that afternoon produced tufts of human hair, several fingernails, and a section of bone.      On October 5, officers returned to the location and found what appeared to be a femur it was discovered approximately 75 feet from the spot where the clothing was found. No further human remains linked to Karl have ever been recovered.      The remains were found approximately Â½ a mile from the home Karl shared with his parents and sisters.      Which leads us to one of the known suspects in Karls case. AP.  AP grew up in Centennial Heights and remained in the area as an adult. In fact, he was employed by Karls uncle at Mr. Radiator in Calumet at the time of Karls disappearance.      AP knew Karl and likely knew the entire Heikell family. AP was a quiet and reserved person who had few friends. He was also a drinker, and was known to be a bad drinker, becoming loud and obnoxious. Those familiar with him and his drinking habits reported that alcohol turned him into a different person.      On Halloween night 1981 AP was with his friend, John and they were unloading a truck in Calumet around 6p. When they finished unloading the truck, John stopped in at Harters party (convenience) store on Pine Street where he saw and spoke with Karl Heikell.      Police believe this sighting of Karl to be credible. AP was drinking at a local watering hole just two doors down from Harter's at the time John saw Karl.      In a November 10, 1984, police interview, AP advised that he did know Karl and had spoken to him on several occasions. He claims he never hung out with Karl, never took him anywhere in a vehicle, and never supplied Karl with alcohol or drugs. He advised that it was his own feeling that Karls disappearance involved foul play.      Also, AP admitted to sexually abusing his own sons. He claims that his last contact with the boys was when the divorce was finalized, and since that time, says there have been no more ""incidents"" involving children.      During the 11-10-84 interview, AP stated that he had nothing to do with Karl's death, and police note that he was able to discuss the matter without being overly nervous. AP agreed to take and was administered a polygraph.      While the results are omitted from the report, a retired Calumet Post Michigan State Police Detective and former lead on the Heikell case confirmed that AP passed the exam. And I know how people feel about polygraphs, but they held a lot of sway in the early 1980s. As of early 2023 AP is still alive and resides in the Calumet area.      Another person mentioned in relation to the case is BL, a 16-year-old who was acquainted with Karl.      Police spoke with BL on November 1, 1981 16 year old BL tells police he saw Karl the afternoon of Halloween and said Karl mentioned trick or treating that night at Lake Linden.      At the end of November police again speak with BL at Calumet High School. He denied having any knowledge of where Karl is and maintained that he has not seen him since Halloween.      In the first week of December, BL's father signs a release that allows both BL and his brother, J. to be polygraphed. The tests are administered, and BL passes.      Unfortunately, there is a tragic closing to BL's story, according to reports from the Michigan State police in the summer of 1982 BL is caught by his parents with stolen property.      His father tells him that he needs to turn himself in to law enforcement. After gathering the stolen items, BL tells his father that he needs to go upstairs and get something. While upstairs in his room, BL uses a gun to shoot himself in the chest. BL died on June 28, 1982. He was 17 years old.      In 1983, all physical evidence in the disappearance and death of Karl Heikell was either released to Karls family, released to the Peterson Funeral Home, or incinerated.      The release and destruction of evidence occurred shortly after the Heikell family petitioned the Houghton County Probate Court to determine a cause of death, location of death, and time of death in order to provide some semblance of closure. If you were hoping for a DNA test on what remained of Karls clothing it cant be done.       DNA testing on his remains to confirm that the bits of bone, nail and hair recovered were from Karl, would require an exhumation.      **So, what happened to Karl Heikell? Was it death by misadventure or a murder?**      Local librarian Dillon Geshel maintains an extensive website about the case. This write up is scratching the surface of what's available.

Like last year, **YOU created the safest Winter Carnival in 31 years!** You Huskied UP and listened to our advice. You looked out for each other. You protected the Husky Pack.       **A ROUGH PAST COUPLE WEEKS**      The past couple of weeks have been rough on many of us for different reasons (e.g., exams, loss of loved ones, health, MSU mass shooting, and even a difficult decision I needed to make regarding a speaker invited to campus by a student organization). HuskyUP"" means kindness, listening, respect, caring, family, sense of belonging, civility, and community&and we have to embrace all these values even when we express different, unpopular, or controversial viewpoints.**SPRING BREAK IS HERE**We can all use a spring break which is coming up. Spring Break is a time when administrators tend to worry the most about students. **As you enjoy Spring Break, were gonna need you to HuskyUP"" and make safe, healthy, responsible, and mature choices.** Whether you are surfing on a beach, cruising on a ship, partying with friends, catching up with buddies, binge-watching movies, fellowshipping with people from your faith, or volunteering, stay safe.      **SPRING BREAK CHECKLIST**      * Keep valuables such as ID cards secure. *Please dont get stuck somewhere without your ID. We cant come get you.*   * Please, please let your parents, guardians, or loved ones know youre safe at least 3x. *No matter what you say, we* *still* *worry about you and always will!*   * Dont travel alone. Whos your travel buddy? Who got your 6? *People up to no good are less likely to mess with people in groups.*   * Dont lose your phone (in fact, just back it up right now on that cloud thing).Â    * Dont rush. Allow yourself time to travel. *Rushing can lead to accidents.*   * Eat and sleep well. *Stop laughing - this is important to your health and wellness.*Â    * Dont give in to peer pressure. *Real friends support,* *not*Â *pressure.*Â    * Make sure someone else has your emergency contact information. Â       **OKAY, LET THE MEMES BEGIN**      As your Dean of Huskies, it would be irresponsible to avoid some of the biggest concerns about spring break: the drinking, the partying, and those intimate encounters. *Yep, I was a college student too!*Â I also recognize that many of you will not be drinking, partying, or doing that *other* thing (*can you see my thankful hands?*).      * **Partying**. The Deans rules: Party in groups. Watch those hands. Dont put cups down in strange places. Remember stranger danger?   * **Intimate encounters**. Yup, I care, so Im going there.

Like last year, **YOU created the safest Winter Carnival in 31 years!** You Huskied UP and listened to our advice. You looked out for each other. You protected the Husky Pack.       **A ROUGH PAST COUPLE WEEKS**      The past couple of weeks have been rough on many of us for different reasons (e.g., exams, loss of loved ones, health, MSU mass shooting, and even a difficult decision I needed to make regarding a speaker invited to campus by a student organization). HuskyUP"" means kindness, listening, respect, caring, family, sense of belonging, civility, and community&and we have to embrace all these values even when we express different, unpopular, or controversial viewpoints.**SPRING BREAK IS HERE**We can all use a spring break which is coming up. Spring Break is a time when administrators tend to worry the most about students. **As you enjoy Spring Break, were gonna need you to HuskyUP"" and make safe, healthy, responsible, and mature choices.** Whether you are surfing on a beach, cruising on a ship, partying with friends, catching up with buddies, binge-watching movies, fellowshipping with people from your faith, or volunteering, stay safe.      **SPRING BREAK CHECKLIST**      * Keep valuables such as ID cards secure. *Please dont get stuck somewhere without your ID. We cant come get you.*   * Please, please let your parents, guardians, or loved ones know youre safe at least 3x. *No matter what you say, we* *still* *worry about you and always will!*   * Dont travel alone. Whos your travel buddy? Who got your 6? *People up to no good are less likely to mess with people in groups.*   * Dont lose your phone (in fact, just back it up right now on that cloud thing).Â    * Dont rush. Allow yourself time to travel. *Rushing can lead to accidents.*   * Eat and sleep well. *Stop laughing - this is important to your health and wellness.*Â    * Dont give in to peer pressure. *Real friends support,* *not*Â *pressure.*Â    * Make sure someone else has your emergency contact information. Â       **OKAY, LET THE MEMES BEGIN**      As your Dean of Huskies, it would be irresponsible to avoid some of the biggest concerns about spring break: the drinking, the partying, and those intimate encounters. *Yep, I was a college student too!*Â I also recognize that many of you will not be drinking, partying, or doing that *other* thing (*can you see my thankful hands?*).      * **Partying**. The Deans rules: Party in groups. Watch those hands. Dont put cups down in strange places. Remember stranger danger?   * **Intimate encounters**. Yup, I care, so Im going there.
